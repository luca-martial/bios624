# BIOS 624 Project: Predicting Mortality

The goal of this project was to build a prediction model for death in participants of the Cardiovascular Health Study (a government sponsored cohort study of adults aged 65 years and older in four US communities).

## Questions Addressed

1. Develop a predictive model for mortality.

2. Is self rated health predictive of mortality beyond the predictive capabilities of the available data?

3. Comment on how useful some of the harder to obtain measurements (MRI, lab variables) are in predicting mortality relative to the other variables.
